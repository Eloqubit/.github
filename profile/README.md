# Eloqubit

**Simplifying the web. Amplifying your business.**

Eloqubit is a remote-first web and software development agency focused on building
**stable, scalable, long-lived systems**.

We work with teams that treat software as infrastructure — not as a disposable
deliverable.

---

## What We Do

We design and build software systems with an emphasis on:

- Clear architecture and explicit tradeoffs
- Maintainability over premature complexity
- Performance, reliability, and scalability
- Long-term technical ownership

Our work typically includes:

- Custom web applications
- Backend systems and APIs
- Architecture design and refactoring
- Performance and stability improvements
- Ongoing engineering partnerships

---

## How We Think

Most software problems are not tooling problems — they are **systems problems**.

Our approach prioritizes:
- Thinking before building
- Fewer, better decisions
- Senior engineers over large teams
- Calm, deliberate execution

We intentionally avoid:
- Buzzword-driven stacks
- Feature factories
- Overpromising speed at the cost of quality
- One-size-fits-all solutions

---

## Engineering Principles

Some principles that guide our work:

- Software is a long-lived system
- Simplicity is a feature
- Tradeoffs should be explicit
- Stability compounds over time
- Clear thinking is a competitive advantage

## This GitHub Organization

This organization contains:

- Internal tools and utilities
- Open-source experiments
- Reference implementations
- Select client-safe examples

Not every repository is production-ready or actively maintained.
Each exists to explore, validate, or document an idea.

---

## Technology Stack

We choose tools based on constraints, not trends.

Commonly used technologies include:

- TypeScript and JavaScript
- React and Next.js
- Node.js, Java, Spring Boot
- SQL and NoSQL databases
- Cloud-native infrastructure

Specific choices vary by project.

## Working With Us

Eloqubit operates as an engineering partner, not a generic dev shop.

We are a good fit for teams that:
- Care about long-term maintainability
- Want technical decisions explained clearly
- Prefer fewer meetings and more thinking
- Value calm, senior execution
